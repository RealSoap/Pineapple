Description:  A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your
 mail hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no
 mail spool to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background.
 Mail is simply forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy
 configuration.
